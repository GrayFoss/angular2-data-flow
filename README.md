# Angular 2 Data Flow Example

This example code is similar to what was discussed at out [Angular meetup on 1/25/2016](http://www.meetup.com/modern-javascript/events/223289966/) although it is a bit more advanced.

It demonstrates:
* How data flows from the root component to child components using data binding.
* How events may be used to flow the data back to parent components.
* How to dynamically add recursive child components.

Try it with three simple steps...
# git clone https://github.com/modern-javascript/angular2-data-flow.git
# npm install
# npm start
